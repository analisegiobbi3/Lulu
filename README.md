# Lulu

## An app specifically for Lulu so that she can have as many treats as she wants

### This app is to practice simple SwiftUI and create a silly little app for Lulu so she can request treats at the tap of a button 

## Purpose

No real purpose other than playing around with swiftUI for fun

## App

## Usage

Tap the button and a voice says treat. I actually got my cat to come running when the audio played.
